    "Can we come up with a trasmission scheme that is more robust in the face of channel loss? Interestingly, the answer is yes, and it involves a different, more versatile basis for the space of images. What we will do is the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* describe the Haar basis, a new basis for the image space\n",
    "* project the image in the new basis\n",
    "* transmit the projection coefficients\n",
    "* rebuild the image using the basis vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "We know a few things: if we choose an orthonormal basis, the analysis and synthesis formulas will be super easy (a simple inner product and a scalar multiplication respectively). The trick is to find a basis that will be robust to the loss of some coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such basis is the **Haar basis**. We cannot go into too many details in this notebook but, for the curious, a good starting point is [here](https://chengtsolin.wordpress.com/2015/04/15/real-time-2d-discrete-wavelet-transform-using-opengl-compute-shader/). (An even better starting point is [these two papers](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/wavelets/article/).) Mathematical formulas aside, the Haar basis works by encoding the information in a *hierarchical* way: the first basis vectors encode the broad information and the higher coefficients encode the detail. Let's have a look. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, to keep things simple, we will remain in the space of square matrices whose size is a power of two. The code to generate the Haar basis matrices is the following: first we generate a 1D Haar vector and then we obtain the basis matrices by taking the outer product of all possible 1D vectors (don't worry if it's not clear, the results are what's important):"
