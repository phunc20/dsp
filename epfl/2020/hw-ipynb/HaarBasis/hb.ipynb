    "Suppose we want to transmit the \"cameraman\" image over a communication channel. The intuitive way to do so is to send the  pixel values one by one, which corresponds to sending the coefficients of the decomposition of the image over the canonical basis. So far, nothing complicated: to send the cameraman image, for instance, we will send $64\\times 64 = 4096$ coefficients in a row. \n",

    "Now suppose that a communication failure takes place after the first half of the pixels have been sent. The received data will allow us to display an approximation of the original image only. If we replace the missing data with zeros, here is what we would see, which is not very pretty:"

    "Can we come up with a trasmission scheme that is more robust in the face of channel loss? Interestingly, the answer is yes, and it involves a different, more versatile basis for the space of images. What we will do is the following: \n",

    "* describe the Haar basis, a new basis for the image space\n",
    "* project the image in the new basis\n",
    "* transmit the projection coefficients\n",
    "* rebuild the image using the basis vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "We know a few things: if we choose an orthonormal basis, the analysis and synthesis formulas will be super easy (a simple inner product and a scalar multiplication respectively). The trick is to find a basis that will be robust to the loss of some coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such basis is the **Haar basis**. We cannot go into too many details in this notebook but, for the curious, a good starting point is [here](https://chengtsolin.wordpress.com/2015/04/15/real-time-2d-discrete-wavelet-transform-using-opengl-compute-shader/). (An even better starting point is [these two papers](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/wavelets/article/).) Mathematical formulas aside, the Haar basis works by encoding the information in a *hierarchical* way: the first basis vectors encode the broad information and the higher coefficients encode the detail. Let's have a look. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, to keep things simple, we will remain in the space of square matrices whose size is a power of two. The code to generate the Haar basis matrices is the following: first we generate a 1D Haar vector and then we obtain the basis matrices by taking the outer product of all possible 1D vectors (don't worry if it's not clear, the results are what's important):"
